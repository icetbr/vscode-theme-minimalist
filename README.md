Compared to Visual Studi Light

Editor
- Lighter black for **code** provides a more pleasant reading experience
- same color for all occurrences when **selecting a word** because why the hell it isn't by default?

Tokens
- Lighter grey **comments** for more unobtrusive coding
  - they are important, but not all the time
- Green **strings** because they shouldn't be red
  - they're not code, so shouldn't be black
- **Main language constructs** as a light red because they are the second most important thing in your code (second to the code itself)
  - they serve to guide your reading (conditionals, async, etc)
- **User defined/libs constructs** as blue for the same reason as above
  - allows for clearer code section definitions
- **'this'** as orange because they are note part of your code and don't add as much as a main language construct
  - helps to know it's there, but easy to ignore

## Misc: light vs dark

While ultimatedly this is a matter of preference, if you wnat to bring science to the mix:
- studies have shown no differences between light/dark colors for eye confort
- what DOES make a difference is context switching
  - If you go from a dark background to a light background too fast (alt + tab google, for instance), your pupils will have to dilate to adapt to the new background, making your eyes tired faster
- use f.lux or similar blue light filtering for better eye confort!
